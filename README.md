## Write Up Solution

After creating and analyzing our visualizations, there were many phenomena to be uncovered.

The first being that the trips for the most used bikes are often started on or around the same stations, this may indicate that we need to increase our supply of bicycles in these areas. Adding more bikes to these stations will allow more users to have a bike available as well as preventing the same bikes from enduring heavy usage which will increase our repair fees, or worse, the risk of user injury.

Another phenomenon that was uncovered from our visualizations, is that most of our riders are not subcribers, but instead the customer count is 3 times the amount of subscribers. It may be wise to start advertising towards consumers/current customers, that may benefit from a subscriber membership. As well as offering, perks to switch over. 

The final phenomenon that I want to recognize is that the most popular start times are at 8 AM and 6 PM. This makes sense as it is similar to when rush hour occurs. People take a bike as they are going to work in the morning and then again when they leave work in the evening. The bump around 6 PM could also be from students leaving class for the day.
